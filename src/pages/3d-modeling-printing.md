Cirrus Designâ€™s highly skilled team can 3D model nearly anything, from small parts and assemblies to large plants and machinery. This allows our customers to create or duplicate almost any item or part, even one with highly complex curves or shapes.

Benefits to having a three-dimensional model:

Allows the user to fully visualize an object
Conceptual design testing (with link to conceptual design testing page)
Manufacture directly from the model, using either additive or reductive techniques
