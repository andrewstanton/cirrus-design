Architectural Engineering Construction is a multi-disciplinary approach to the planning, design, construction and operation of a building. 3D scanning plays an integral role in the architecture, engineering and construction field, providing data that’s useful for customers whether they are planning new work or updating existing projects.

We help our clients reduce file space consumption and offer optimized design services, with fast scan times that create detailed 3D point cloud information. Our web interface technology means it’s easy for our clients to access their scans. And our ability to add tags, hyperlinks and rich text to three-dimensional scans allows for clear jobsite communication.

Description on how scanning can be used to verify throughout the entire construction process. Pre- verification of site, mid- verification that the structure has been completed according to plan and that all the systems have been installed according to plan. Post- verification to see how every piece of equipment will be laid out.
