Our 3D scanning technology offers a powerful and effective means to gather existing conditions, which includes machine locations, piping, equipment and existing building structure. In our experience, weâ€™ve found that older plants are often lacking accurate prints or drawings.

This allows our customers to accurately map and document existing conditions and plan future projects. This will allow our clients to avoid having to reacquire the same documentation with each project.

A detailed three-dimensional representation of an industrial plant, accurate to within about 1/8th of an inch, can be created safely, quickly and efficiently, without outages or disruption to the operation of the facility.
