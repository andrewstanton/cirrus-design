Cirrus Design in partnership with Belgian AirShaper, the online aerodynamics platform is offering virtual aerodynamics services as the integral part of his design and development process. By extending expertise in this area, we can further improve the performance of our designs.

**Effortlessly check and improve your aerodynamic design.**

This is how it works: Upload your geometry file, determine the desired wind or flow velocity and start the flow calculation at the push of a button. At best after a few hours, you will be informed by e-mail of the end of the calculation and will receive a detailed result report with values for drag and lift as well as the aerodynamic moments. Furthermore, the drag coefficient and the required power are determined. Pictures show 3D pressure clouds, surface pressures, surface friction and streamlines, which identify aerodynamically critical areas and provide indications of possible optimization.
