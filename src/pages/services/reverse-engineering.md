Cirrus Design can help your company reverse engineer a product, converting a point cloud into a 3D model.

The use of our technology and capabilities has helped our clients reverse engineer machinery wear items and parts with complex geometry, such as turbines, bearings and scroll cases. This saves time and money by alleviating the need to physically visit a plant or facility for simple information, pictures, or to capture specific dimensions. All of that data will now be accessible from the 3D Point Cloud that we provide, giving a high-resolution and distortion-free visualization of the structure thatâ€™s accessible from the comfort of an office.
